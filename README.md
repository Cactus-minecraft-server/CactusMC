# ðŸŽ® Copper: Minecraft Server in Rust

## Introduction

Copper is a project aimed at creating a Minecraft server using the Rust programming language. The goal is to explore Rust's potential in game server development and demonstrate how to implement a complex game protocol in a performant and secure way. Rust is well-known for its memory safety features without compromising performance, making it an excellent choice for this type of project.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers several advantages for developing a Minecraft server:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust provides unmatched memory safety through its ownership system, reducing the risks of memory leaks and common bugs like segmentation faults, without the need for a garbage collector.
- **Performance**: Compiled directly to machine code, Rust rivals C and C++ in terms of performance, while offering greater safety.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model and thread management system allow for efficient handling of simultaneous player connections without the risk of race conditions.
- **Modern Ecosystem**: Rust has a growing ecosystem with tools like Cargo (its package manager and build system) and libraries such as Tokio for asynchronous programming, making development efficient and enjoyable.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Rust
- **Main Libraries:** [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
