# ðŸŽ® Copper: Minecraft Server in Rust

## Introduction

Copper is a project aimed at creating a Minecraft server using the Rust programming language. The goal is to explore Rust's potential in game server development and demonstrate how to implement a complex game protocol in a performant and secure way. Rust is well-known for its memory safety features without compromising performance, making it an excellent choice for this type of project.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers several advantages for developing a Minecraft server:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust provides unmatched memory safety through its ownership system, reducing the risks of memory leaks and common bugs like segmentation faults, without the need for a garbage collector.
- **Performance**: Compiled directly to machine code, Rust rivals C and C++ in terms of performance, while offering greater safety.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model and thread management system allow for efficient handling of simultaneous player connections without the risk of race conditions.
- **Modern Ecosystem**: Rust has a growing ecosystem with tools like Cargo (its package manager and build system) and libraries such as Tokio for asynchronous programming, making development efficient and enjoyable.

## Features

- **TCP Connection Management**: Efficiently handle multiple player connections concurrently.
- **Minecraft Protocol Implementation**: Full support for the Minecraft network protocol.
- **World and Player Management**: Dynamic and efficient handling of world data and player states.
- **Real-time Communication**: Low-latency communication between the server and clients.
- **Chat and Command System**: Built-in support for chat functionality and server commands.
- **Data Persistence**: Save player and world data efficiently.
- **Latency Optimization**: Optimized code paths for minimizing server lag and ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Rust
- **Main Libraries:** [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
